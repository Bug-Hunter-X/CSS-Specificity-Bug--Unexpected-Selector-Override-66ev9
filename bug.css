The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error where the specificity of selectors unexpectedly overrides the intended styling.  The `.container` class is initially styled, but the more specific `div.container` selector then overrides it, even though it seems redundant. This can be difficult to debug because the issue lies in the subtle difference in selector specificity. 

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

div.container {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```
